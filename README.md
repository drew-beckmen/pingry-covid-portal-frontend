This repository contains the frontend code for The Pingry School's internal COVID-19 tracking portal. The portal provides a simple interface to create quarantines and isolations for individual students. It also allows users to enter the contacts of a presumed or confirmed positive case of COVID-19 so that they are automatically placed in quarantine. This React app is powered by a Rails API backend, which also contains a fully-fledged email notification system to notify students and parents whenever they are placed into quarantine/isolation and when their status is updated. The Pingry School will use this portal and the data contained within to make critical operational decisions in order to keep students safe. 

The backend repository is located [HERE](https://github.com/drew-beckmen/pingry-covid-portal-backend).

The project is fully deployed and operational. To land on the login page, navigate to https://tracking.pingryanywhere.org/login.
